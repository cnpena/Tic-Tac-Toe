A fun version of the basic Tic-Tac-Toe game! <br>
I took the basic game and gave the user more options to customize their game featuring two of my favorite animated shows- Rick and Morty and Bob's Burgers. <br>

First, the user is presented with all 3 game choices, Classic, Rick and Morty or Bob's Burgers. In classic mode, players play with the traditional 'X' and 'O' pieces. <br>

For the other two modes, the player is presented with icons corresponding to the appropriate show. Once both players choose their icons, the game begins. <br>

Once the game has ended, either by one player winning or by tie, the players can choose to play again with the same theme or restart and be taken back to the home screen.
